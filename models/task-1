For this task, here is the model description for classifying whether the output would be an electron or a photon. The data will be preprocessed with normalization and quantization to 8-bits.

This model combine custom layers and EfficientNetB2 for purpose of effectively learn and classify the features of electrons and photons impinging on a calorimeter.
The residual block, channel reduction, and EfficientNetB2 suppose to help the model learn complex features, while the dense layers, dropout, and global average pooling enable it to perform the final classification.
