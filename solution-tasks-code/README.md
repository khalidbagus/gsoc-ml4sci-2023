# Typo & Update
There is typo in the ipnyb markup text for additional task (task 3)
Each of the models separately are trained on different subset of original data

1. jet0_run0
2. jet0_run1
3. jet0_run3

Resulting in 3 different models.

Also i forgot to delete the markup text at first page of task 3 solution (that tells we're going to CNN, instead of GNN).
The rest is unaffected, because the models itself train on each respective different subset of original data.

Added solution for task 1 using PyTorch: GSoC_Task_1_PyTorch_Mod6.ipynb
