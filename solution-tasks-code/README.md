# Typo
There is typo in the ipnyb markup text for additional task (task 3)
Each of the models separately are trained on different subset of original data

1. jet0_run0
2. jet0_run1
3. jet0_run3

resulting in 3 different models.

Also i forgot to delete the markup text at first page of task 3 solution (that tells we're going to CNN, instead of GNN).
The rest is unaffected, because the models itself train on each respective different subset of original data.
